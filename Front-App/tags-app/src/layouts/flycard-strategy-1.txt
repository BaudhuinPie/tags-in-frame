// I want to map all the elements to display
// More elements need to be smaller. Their elevation must be reduced as much as they are but at square root
// Hence, if lonely one have an elevation of 16 units ; 4 elements must dived their elevation by 2 = 8 .
// All together they fit inside a box which may change of size. 

// The Parent box absolute size = ground variable

// the ground variable is weighted for elevation & z-index level = root variable

// items displayed number is square rooted = floor step

// the level = root / floor

// weighting the ground variable means to set only some values at the root. 
// we need a function which makes the job. 
// This func take a gap argument between values to set.
// root = ground - ground % gap .

// On peut immaginer que la partie computed se fait en JS . 
// Root & floor sont pass√© dans le html OU le CSS directement. 

// Savoir si update varaible dans CSS = DOM update ou si dans HTML = DOM update
